Real-Time Network-Based Intrusion Detection System

A machine learning-powered cybersecurity solution that detects and predicts abnormal network behavior in real time.


Real-time Network Traffic Analysis and Anomaly Visualization

Project Overview

As cyber threats and data breaches continue to rise, organizations need automated, intelligent systems to detect intrusions before they cause significant damage. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often rely on static rules or outdated signatures, making them ineffective against zero-day attacks or evolving threats.

This project introduces a real-time, machine learning-based intrusion detection system using the Isolation Forest algorithm to accurately identify anomalies in live network traffic.

Problem Statement

Most traditional IDS tools:

Depend on static rule sets or predefined signatures

Struggle to detect unknown or evolving attacks

Generate high false positives and delayed responses

These limitations leave networks vulnerable to emerging and dynamic cyber threats.

Solution

This system leverages machine learning to dynamically analyze real-time network traffic.
Using the Isolation Forest model, it detects abnormal patterns that deviate from normal traffic behavior â€” identifying intrusions early and accurately.
